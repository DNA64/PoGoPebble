## HOW DO I GET IT
PokeWatch is in development and not currently available in the Pebble app store, but you can get it by [downloading the .pbw](https://github.com/tetrapus/PoGoPebble/releases/download/0.1/PokeWatch.pbw) and opening it with the Pebble app on your phone.

If the above method doesn't work, you can load it via CloudPebble as follows:
1. In the settings menu of your Pebble app, select "Enable developer mode".
2. A new "Developer Connection" menu item should appear. Turn on the developer connection by flipping the toggle switch.
3. Go to https://cloudpebble.net and sign in with your Pebble account.
4. Click "Import" and select "Import from Github"
5. Enter the following details:
- Project Name: PokeWatch
- Github Project: github.com/tetrapus/PoGoPebble
6. Click "Import"
7. Select "app.js" from the menu on the left and click the green play button in the upper right corner. This should upload and install the app to your Pebble.

## Coming Soon
- Support for other pebbles
- Support for gyms and pokestops
- Interactable watchapp, with the ability to scroll through nearby pokemon and hide individual pokemon from the interface
- Compass Support
